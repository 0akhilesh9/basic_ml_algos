The code can be run in two modes.

Default mode uses the SVM algorithm where learning rate is (1/(lambda * t)

The other mode uses the SGD algorithm. To run in this mode please pass '--trainMode="alternate"' as the command line parameter.

The description of the modules are provided in the code itself.
